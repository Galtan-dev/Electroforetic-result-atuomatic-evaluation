# project for elektroforesis result resolution

## project for automatic evaluation of photos of electroforetic results, idea is to segmentate strips and export their coordinates. After that separate samples and standard and by set standard molecular weights, calculate weights of samplse by linear regresion


### list of files
  -  FIJI macro for image preprocesing
  -  testing results from makro in form of coordinates of samples in .txt file
  -  python script for separation of coordinates and calculation molecular weigth from set molecular weights of standards
  -  input photos
